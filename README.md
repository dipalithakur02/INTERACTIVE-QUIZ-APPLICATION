## DESCRIPTION: The Quiz Application is a web-based project designed to test users' knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application demonstrates the core principles of front-end web development, including dynamic content rendering, event handling, and DOM manipulation. The project was developed using the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor, a popular and versatile platform for writing and debugging code. The application allows users to answer questions one at a time, provides instant feedback on their responses, and keeps track of their score throughout the quiz. The questions and options are dynamically loaded from a predefined dataset, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience. The application is styled using CSS to create a clean and modern interface, with responsive design elements that make it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. JavaScript handles the logic, including checking answers, updating the score, and navigating between questions. Once all questions are answered, the application displays the final score and allows the user to restart the quiz. This project is an excellent tool for learning and practicing web development skills, as it covers essential concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management. The Quiz Application can be used in various contexts, such as educational platforms, online training programs, or even as a fun trivia game for personal use. Its simplicity and interactivity make it a versatile tool for both learning and entertainment purposes. Future enhancements could include adding a timer, incorporating different types of questions, or storing high scores in local storage to further improve the user experience. Overall, this project serves as a practical example of how basic web technologies can be combined to create an engaging and functional application.
